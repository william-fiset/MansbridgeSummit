      "description":"\tPrior to joining Twitter, Ladurantaye was a journalist at the Globe and Mail where he covered a ridiculous range of stories and also worked as an editor. His versatility often saw him reassigned to the country’s top stories - he rode campaign buses, reported from the House of Commons, delved into the activities of serial killers and deconstructed the failures (and sometimes even the successes) of massive global corporations.\n\n\t His last post was as the national newspaper’s media reporter, a job that allowed him to delve deep into the heart of the Canadian media industry at a time of brutal cutbacks and rapid innovation.\n\n\tA two-time National Newspaper Award winner (and one-time loser), Ladurantaye also ran some of the country’s most innovative and award-winning newsrooms before joining the Globe and is a regular contributor to radio and television stations across the country.\n\n\tHe launched the Ottawa Business Journal’s 24-hour breaking news website in 1999, worked to serve Robertson Davies’ legacy at the Peterborough Examiner and guided the Kingston Whig-Standard through a period of difficult change. He also covered the police beat at the Ottawa Sun.\n",
